# Ame ni Kou Making Technique Translation
A translation of the Making Technique section of Shigure Ui's Ame ni Kou (Pages 142 to 150). \
There are more sections in this book that can be translated (Preface, Uniform Guide, etc), but I wasn't sure whether or not there was demand for a human-translated version. If you'd like to see it, feel free to let me know. \
(This might be a little redundant to say, but for people that are new to github: click the ame_ni_kou_making_technique_tl.md file above to open the actual translation file.)
