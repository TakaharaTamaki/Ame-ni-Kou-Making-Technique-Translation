## Step 1: Draft
This time, I will use the rough draft as the draft. At this stage, I tentatively commit to this composition, so that I can trace over the rough draft*. To motivate myself, I also set the light source at this time.

### Point!
Whenever it's difficult to quickly draw a rough draft, I go one step back and draw the rough overall layout first.

    The sentence here is phrased to imply that this is one of the ways she addresses the issue (not the only way). Also, interestingly, the verb used here is "cut" (lit. "to cut a draft") but apparently this is just another way of saying "to draw" (https://twitter.com/arinacchi/status/861669683254018048).

## Step 2: Color Rough Draft
In order to visualize the balance of color in the illustration as a whole, I apply appropriate colors from below the draft.\
I will reference the colors painted here for the final copy, so I set the overall color balance at this stage.\
I wanted to draw a sunshower, so I focused on the orange to blue gradation.

## Step 3: Line Art
The pen I am using for the line art is "Pencil R" customized to be slightly harder than default.
I wan t to change the color of the lines and add depth later, so I finely separated the head area into many layers.\
For the eyes, there are times when I carry forward the lines from the rough draft directly to the line art, to avoid changing the impression they give.
<details>
    <summary>TL Note</summary>
    I can't find "Pencil R" in Clip Studio Paint. It might be equivalent to Real Pencil, or it could be the 鉛筆R asset (https://assets.clip-studio.com/en-us/detail?id=1702962)

## Step 4: Coloring
I separate the parts of the drawing by color.\
I use the "Enclose and Fill" tool to go ahead and fill in the parts.\
Filling in the skin excites me the most, so I start with that first.

### Skin:
After applying a faint gradation from the forehead to the center of the head using the airbrush tool, I draw the cast shadow from the hair using the "Dense Watercolor" tool.\
I apply a fiarly strong orange color to the cheeks to give a cute impression, and fill the sclera using a soft color.

### Coloring of the Eye:
When painting the eye, I pay particular attention to brightness and saturation during color selection. \
The overall saturation of my illustrations isn't that high, so I manage this by putting colors with high saturation and complementary colors into the eye to make it colorful, so that the illustration leaves a stronger impression when viewed as a whole.\
It's critical to use light reflections to convey the moistness of the eye.
<details>
    <summary>TL Note</summary>
    Sorry for the long sentence.
    In other words, she uses two types of colors in the eyes (for the purpose of making a stronger impression): "colors with high saturation" and "complementary colors".

### Adding More Light as a Whole:
I wanted to see the overall balance of the illustration, so I stopped packing details into their respective parts, and added light to the illustration as a whole.

### Adding Flower Petals:
I now transcribe the line art of the flowers, which I had put off until now because it seemed hard.\
For the flowers, I chose poppies, which in the language of flowers means "Premonition of Love".\
When I draw flowers in my illustrations, I place a high importance on the flower's meaning.

### Hair:
I paint color onto the overall illustration while keeping shadows and highlights in mind.
I make full use of the "Dense Watercolor" and "Airbrush" tools as well.\
Since I placed the light source on the left side, I picked up a color similar to the sky's and spread it vaugely and broadly over the hair on the right side.

### Uniform:
I like uniforms that are ironed and crisp, so I paint colors on thick so that the wrinkles end up looking a little stiff.\
The surface areas of the sailor collar and ribbon are small, so I strengthen the contrast between its highlights and shadows to make sure it leaves an impression.

### Arm:
To draw out the softness of the girl's arm, I gently, gently apply color using the airbrush.
After that, I apply strong cast shadows and highlights to make the arm pop out.

    <summary>TL Note</summary>
    She said it twice because it's very important. lol.
</details>

### Nails:
For the nails, I picked up a soft color similar to the skin's, and use highlights to convey the difference in texture from that of the skin. \
I change the color of the line art to skin-color to soften the impression at the base, where it meets the finger.

### Plastic Umbrella:
I go ahead and put shadows and light reflections into the handle. The area around the neck of the handle was similar to the skin, and seemed like it was going to get buried in it, so I used a strong highlight. \
I didn't know how the plastic portion would reflect light, so I took pictures of an umbrella I had at home and used those as reference when coloring. I paid attention to making a clean interface between the highly transparent white and completely white areas. 

### Flower:
Ultimately, the flowers are just decorative items, so I chose not to make them complex, to avoid making the illustration look cluttered. \
I kept it to a gradation and a shadow to convey texture, with the occasional highlight. I blurred the flower petals in the front to add a sense of depth.
<details>
    <summary>TL Note</summary>
    Instead of "shadow to convey texture", the literal term used was 1-Kage (lit. "1-Shadow"). From what I looked up, it appears to be a type of shadow applied for the purpose of conveying the texture of the object. There is also a 2-Kage, which seems to be for conveying depth/three-dimensionality. If you know of a better translation for this concept, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Step 5: Finishing Touches
I look at the overall balance of the illustration, and use the Multiply and Overlay blending modes to adjust the color. \
I also tried changing the positions of the flowers based on the viewer's perspective. After that, I use Glow layers to add in the rain and rainbow, and finish.
<details>
    <summary>TL Note</summary>
    She refers to a "Glow Layer", but from what I found, the way to accomplish a "Glow Layer" in Clip Studio Paint is to set a layer's blending mode to "Add(Glow)".
